#  AI_Fairness_in_Hip_and_Knee_Bony_Anatomy_Segmentation
<p align="justify">This GitHub repository includes all Python codes and a sample imaging dataset to address AI-powered segmentation of hip and knee bony anatomy using plain radiographs, with a specific focus on identifying and addressing discernible biases related to sex and race. This study, through extensive evaluation, provides insights into the underlying causes of biases in AI-based knee and hip image segmentation. It presents targeted mitigation strategies to alleviate biases related to sex and race, fostering automatic segmentation results that are fair, impartial, and safe in the context of AI. We believe that our contribution holds the potential to enhance clinical outcomes, supporting both clinical decision-making and osteoarthritis (OA) research, thus we have made all codes and the dataset publicly and freely available for open scientific research and any educational purposes.
